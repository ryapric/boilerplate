# You can call this file whatever you want, but the default file location is at
# `/etc/ansible/hosts`, so I'm calling it `hosts`. You can point to this file at
# run time with the `-i` flag. This file can be in INI or YAML format, but while
# the YAML format is more powerful to programmatically edit, this INI format is
# much easier to read and work with.

# You can lable groups of targets/hosts in INI sections
